# Introduction
Welcome to the developer documentation for gol - a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This document aims to provide an overview of the project, as well as a description of how to get started with developing on the project.

# Project Overview
gol is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

gol is a command-line application that takes an initial state as input and produces a sequence of images showing the evolution of the game over time.

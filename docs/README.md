# Welcome to Mikasa

The Mikasa team developed autonomous smart contracts using the Ink platform, which is a Substrate-based smart contract language designed for the Polkadot ecosystem. The concept can be adapted and reproduced for Starknet.

A Mikasa smart contract can emit a message in the future based on time or built-in triggers that work independently. They don't need external input to work. By listening to events on the blockchain, such as gas fees, transaction counts, or wallet counts, these smart contracts are able to "wake up" and execute their functions whenever needed.

## Quick start

You can install Mikasa using `this`, `that`, or the `mikasa` CLI.

+++ NPM
```
npm install retypeapp --global
retype watch
```
+++ Yarn
```
yarn global add retypeapp
retype watch
```
+++ dotnet
```
dotnet tool install retypeapp --global
retype watch
```
+++

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running.

!!!
You will require either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/), or the [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI to be installed before installing Retype. Only one of those three is required, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. :raised_hands:

All operating systems are supported, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Features

#### :icon-shield-check: It just works

Retype has been built to be easy to use and should _"just work"_ out-of-the-box without any special configuration or troublesome setup.

#### :icon-zap: Lightning fast

Don't blink. Retype was built for speed.

#### :icon-gear: Easy install

[Installation](/Node/getting-started.md) takes only a few seconds. Then all you need is one Markdown `.md` file which Retype will start building a new website from.

#### :icon-plug: Powerful

Project level [configuration](/GoL%20frontend/project.md) using `retype.yml` unlocks many more Retype features and customization.

#### :icon-pencil: Simple formatting

Pages are [formatted](/Node/formatting.md) using Markdown syntax and Retype [components](/ink%20Smart%20Contract/readme.md). Page level [configuration](/GoL%20frontend/page.md) is available, such as setting a custom navigation [`label`](/GoL%20frontend/page.md#label) or [`icon`](/GoL%20frontend/page.md#icon).

#### :icon-sync: Live reload

If a change is detected, such as editing and saving an `.md` file, your Retype website will be updated almost instantly within the browser.

#### :icon-server: Host anywhere

Retype generates a basic HTML website that you can host on any web hosting service, or for free using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). No special server-side software or external dependencies are required. You can host your Retype site as a public website or as a private website inside your organization.

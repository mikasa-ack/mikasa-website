## Why not with Cairo 1.0??

The choice of Ink was strategic, as we decided not to go with Starknet directly due to the lack of maturity of Cairo 1.0 and the tooling. Ink provides a more seamless Rust-based dev experience and can serve as a benchmark for future developments in the Cairo 1.0 ecosystem.

Kaioshin, a Substrate-based Starknet sequencer under development, can use the autonomous smart contract pallet. Due to the pallets logic not being tied to Ink, it can be used for Starknet, custom Layer 3 solutions, or public Layer 2. Mikasa also highlights cross-platform compatibility.

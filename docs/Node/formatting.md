# Formatting

Markdown `.md` pages are plain text documents with a simple human readable syntax that aims to make writing for the internet easier.

No special software is required to create an `.md` file. Any basic text editor will do. Just save the file with a `.md` file extension.

Please see [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a full demonstration of the formatting possibilities and best practices.

## Quick start

The following sample demonstrates a very basic `.md` page sample with page title and one paragraph.

```md
# Page title here

This is a paragraph.
```

We can build on the above sample by adding more content and formatting, such as **bold** text, images, and lists.

```md
# Page title here

This is a paragraph.

Both [internal](README.md) and [external](https://example.com) links work.

Another paragraph with **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~, and `code` samples.

## Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

> "Cool! This is a quotation."

Need to draw attention to something? Use an alert.

```

At a very basic level, to create a new page for your Retype project, do the following:

1. Make a `readme.md` file
2. Add a `# title`
3. Start writing

### Home page

Ideally, your project will include a default file (`readme.md`, `index.md`, or `default.md`) within the root of the project. If a default file is present within the root folder, Retype will use that page as your home page. Clicking on the top-left logo or title will navigate to the home page.

Those default files can also be placed inside of any folder within the project. Given the following folder and file structure, where `Guides` is a folder...

```
|-- Guides
    |-- readme.md
    |-- getting-started.md
|-- readme.md
```

...Retype will create three pages in your website and the pages will be available at the following locations:

1. `/`
2. `/guides/`
3. `/guides/getting-started/`

!!!
If your home page is empty or blank, double check that you have a default page in the root of your project folder. The default file can be named `readme.md`, `index.md`, or `default.md`.

## Components

In addition to the standard Markdown options, Retype includes many custom [components](/ink%20Smart%20Contract/readme.md) so you can easily add extra [!badge :gem: flair :gem:] to your document.

The most commonly used Retype components include [Alert](/ink%20Smart%20Contract/alert.md) and [Tab](/ink%20Smart%20Contract/tab.md):
